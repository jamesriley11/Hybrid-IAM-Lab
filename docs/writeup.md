## Overview
- What the project is
- What project it simulates
- What was built
- What skills is demonstrates

## Architecture & Environment
Short description of each component and reference of architecture diagram. Keep high level
- On-prem AD/DC and client
- Entra tenant
- AD Connect
- Test users/groups
- Cloud SSO app
- PowerShell scripts and automation

## Identity Lifecycle DEsign
- How users are created, groups, etc.

## SSO Implementation
- Why SSO matters
- Why SAML was chosen
- Authentication flow
- How it's restricted

## Automation & Scripting
- What was automated
- Why automation matters
- What risks are reduced
- Link to scripts

## Security Outcomes & What this demonstrates
What dpes this lab demonstrate
- Hybrid IAM understanding
- Cloud identity security
- access control design
- Authentication hardening
- SSO configs
- Security automation
- Troubleshooting identity issues

# Limitations & Future Improvements
- Would integrate device compliance
- Centralise logs into Sentinel
- Implement Privilege Identity Management (PIM)
- Add access reviews, and more logging/auditing
